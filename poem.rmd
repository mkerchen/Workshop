## First Verse 
<Put the first two verses of Jabberwocky by Lewis Carrol in this section>


’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves   
 Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:   
All mimsy were the borogoves,   
And the mome raths outgrabe.   

“Beware the Jabberwock, my son!   
The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!   
Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun   
 The frumious Bandersnatch!”   

## Second Verse
<Put the first two verses of The Road Not Taken by Robert Frost here>


Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,  
And sorry I could not travel both  
And be one traveler, long I stood  
And looked down one as far as I could  
To where it bent in the undergrowth;  

Then took the other, as just as fair,  
And having perhaps the better claim,  
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;  
Though as for that the passing there  
Had worn them really about the same,   


## Third Verse
<Put the first two verses of The Walrus and the Carpenter here>
"The sun was shining on the sea,   
      Shining with all his might:   
He did his very best to make   
      The billows smooth and bright —   
And this was odd, because it was   
      The middle of the night.   

The moon was shining sulkily,   
      Because she thought the sun   
Had got no business to be there   
      After the day was done —   
"It's very rude of him," she said,   
      "To come and spoil the fun."    

## Last Verse
<Put a short poem of your choice 8-20 lines,here>

I. Wreathed in myrtle, my sword I'll conceal  
  Like those champions devoted and brave,  
When they plunged in the tyrant their steel,  
  And to Athens deliverance gave.  
  

II.Beloved heroes! your deathless souls roam  
  In the joy breathing isles of the blest;  
Where the mighty of old have their home -  
  Where Achilles and Diomed rest.  


III.In fresh myrtle my blade I'll entwine,  
  Like Harmodious, the gallant and good,  
When he made at the tutelar shrine  
  A libation of Tyranny's blood.  


IV.Ye deliverers of Athens from shame!  
  Ye avengers of Liberty's wrongs!  
Endless ages shall cherish your fame  
  Embalmed in their echoing songs!
